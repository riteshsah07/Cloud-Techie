🚀 Auto-Scaling Cloud Architecture for Streaming Platforms
📌 About the Project
As part of Prompt Builder Hackathon 2025, our team ranked in the Top 10 among 70+ teams and 300+ participants. We built an Auto-Scaling Cloud Architecture designed for streaming platforms, focusing on scalability, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency. The project replicates how streaming giants handle massive traffic spikes while ensuring a seamless viewing experience.

⚙️ Key Features
Launch Template → Automated creation of EC2 instances with pre-configured settings.

Auto Scaling Group → Automatically scales resources to meet fluctuating traffic.

Elastic Load Balancer → Distributes traffic evenly across multiple EC2 instances.

Public Access Testing → Deployed application on EC2 and verified through public IPv4 (port 8080).

Performance Testing → Used BlazeMeter to measure system performance under high load.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Cloud Platform: AWS

Compute: Amazon EC2 (Launch Templates)

Scaling: Auto Scaling Groups

Networking: Elastic Load Balancer

Testing Tool: BlazeMeter

🌟 What I Learned
Designing highly available and scalable architectures in the cloud.

Leveraging Auto Scaling and Load Balancers for real-world traffic management.

Applying performance testing to validate system reliability.

Collaborating as a team under hackathon time constraints to deliver a production-grade solution.

📈 Outcome
This project not only enhanced my Cloud Architecture & DevOps skills, but also showcased how to design and test a resilient, cost-optimized infrastructure for streaming use cases.
